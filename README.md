![](.gitbook/assets/assets_-lwynuwyttit0vocr5i4_-lamimwvmflf3gvi96hq_-lz7ezohwl0ztttwibv9_school.png)


 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.


Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
